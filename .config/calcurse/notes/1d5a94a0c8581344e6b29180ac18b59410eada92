- Softwares
	- MFEM/GLVis runs fluently (/usr/local/lib with sudo)
- Visualization Tools
	- what's your take on GLVis in terms of its pros and cons / strengths and limits
	- what other visualization tools do we use often in this group
		- VisIt?
			- run fluently on the ubuntu machine by downloading the binaries (only offered for a couple common OS's)
			- building (despite of choosing the minimal version) failed on my main machine running arch linux
			- one of the maintainers replied saying that the issue would be fixed in the next release
		- Paraview?
		- I tried GLVis on a poisson solution (.vtk) computed by deal.ii and it didn't work
- Next up
	1. Implement convection-dominated convection diffusion problem in deal.ii/mfem for
		- GaLS
		- DG/HDG
	2. Read literature on apos and AMR, get familiar with the analysis
	3. Implement basic problems on AMR (Poisson, Stokes, convection diffusion, ...)
	4. read and implement DPG on various problems
