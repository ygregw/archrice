* How to set different b.c.'s other than homogeneous Dirichlet illstrated for the simplest Poisson problem?

* **FEValues** class:
    Given one instance of three objects respectively from *FiniteElement*,
    *Quadrature*, and (implicitly) *Mapping* classes, provide the user with
    information about values and gradients of shape functions at quadrature
    points on a real cell.
    NB: Actually, there is a fourth (third if the Mapping object is the default
    one, i.e., bilinear Q1 mapping) one, the *UpdateFlags* object.
