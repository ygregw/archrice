A paper that might be interesting: [Robust a posteriori error estimates for HDG method for convectionâ€“diffusion equations](https://academic.oup.com/imajna/article-abstract/36/1/437/2363831?redirectedFrom=PDF)
Some highlights:
- The a posteriori error analysis for the HDG method for second-order elliptic problems has been presented in Cockburn & Zhang (2012, 2013), where the error incorporates only the flux and a post-processed solution used in the estimators.
- The paper claims to offer the first a posteriori estimator for convection dominated convection diffusion problems that is realized through the techniques in Fu et al. (2015) which *proves a condition number to be independent of the diffusion coef*. The perks of this a pos. est. therefore lie in no post-processing and robustness w.r.t. diffusion coefficient.
- Frederick Qiu is the corresponding author. I know the first author. He is from my undergrad univ. It might worth consideration to contact him in the near future after I establish fair level of understanding and progress on this project.

Q:
1. Is the HDG code we have for CDCD based on the Fu 2015 paper?

- Softwares
	- MFEM/GLVis runs fluently (/usr/local/lib with sudo)
- Visualization Tools
	- what's your take on GLVis in terms of its pros and cons / strengths and limits
	- what other visualization tools do we use often in this group
		- VisIt?
			- run fluently on the ubuntu machine by downloading the binaries (only offered for a couple common OS's)
			- building (despite of choosing the minimal version) failed on my main machine running arch linux
			- one of the maintainers replied saying that the issue would be fixed in the next release
		- Paraview?
		- I tried GLVis on a poisson solution (.vtk) computed by deal.ii and it didn't work
- Next up
	1. Implement convection-dominated convection diffusion problem in deal.ii/mfem for
		- GaLS
		- DG/HDG
	2. Read literature on apos and AMR, get familiar with the analysis
	3. Implement basic problems on AMR (Poisson, Stokes, convection diffusion, ...)
	4. read and implement DPG on various problems
